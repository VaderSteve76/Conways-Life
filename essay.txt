Coming into this project I had never heard of or seen Conways Game of Life.
  This was quite an interesting theory and project. I spent alot of time 
  reading about this theory and looking at other examples of code to get a 
  good idea of what is going on here. First was to plan out how to go about
  creating this project ie. what languages, frameworks I was going to use.
  Obviously I ended up using React, but I did not use any other frameworks 
  like Canvas.js. But I did end up using bootstrap. I really wanted to 
  challenge myself with this since it was the first time I had seen or heard 
  of this. I kept my code as vanilla as possible, straight up React and javascript. 
  It took me awhile with some of the logic and some trial and error of what 
  worked and what didn't and where. It was touch and go here and there but 
  in the end my project worked. The hardest part of this was my play function 
  inside of my main component. There was alot of logic going into this one 
  function as I spent the majority of my time implementing this functionality. 
  A bunch of errors and trial and error went into this, but in the end I made it there.
  I did end up having to revisit my javascript fundamentals a little bit while trying
  to implement this functionality. It's amazing how much one can remember just by
  reading a little or revisiting previous code you have written. One thing is for 
  sure nobody can remember all of these things without having to go back and peek.
  I think at some point I will redo this project or start from scratch and build
  a really good example of Conway's Game of Life.
